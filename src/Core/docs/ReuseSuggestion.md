# Pieces.Os.Core.SdkModel.ReuseSuggestion
This is the ReuseSuggestion. Mainly creating an additional model here because I imagine that we will want to add some additional data to this in the future (potentially with more numerical data that is emitted from the ML Models)  **Note: suggested is required here because we will want to say if we suggested to take this action of reuse or not.  ** Thoughts here. We could potentially return Assets: which would be an iterable of assets in most relavent order for the user to reuse if they want.

## Properties
