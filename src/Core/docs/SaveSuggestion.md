# Pieces.Os.Core.SdkModel.SaveSuggestion
This is the SaveSuggestion. Mainly creating an additional model here because I imagine that we will want to add some additional data to this in the future (potentially with more numerical data that is emitted from the ML Models)  **Note: suggested is required here because we will want to say if we reccomend to take this action of save or not.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Schema** | [**EmbeddedModelSchema**](EmbeddedModelSchema.md) |  | [optional] 
**Suggested** | **bool** | This is a boolean, that will say if you should or should not take action. |
