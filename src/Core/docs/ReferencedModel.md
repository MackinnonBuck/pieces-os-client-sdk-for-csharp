# Pieces.Os.Core.SdkModel.ReferencedModel
*****NOTE:***** This is the basic referencedModel, for Now since we dont have a FlattenedModel, im going to simply not include the reference, because I do NOT want to attach a Model here (would cause breaking changes if we switched from a Model -> a flattenedModel). and (2) we are under going Model changes to the Model, so would cause issues.

## Properties
